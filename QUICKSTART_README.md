# üöÄ SUM v2 Quick Start Guide

## The Fastest Way to Experience Simplicity

### Option 1: Test Locally WITHOUT Any Dependencies (Easiest)

```bash
# No Redis needed! No PostgreSQL needed!
python quickstart_local.py

# In another terminal, test it:
python test_simple.py
```

That's it! You'll see SUM working in seconds (after model loads).

### Option 2: Full Setup with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the automatic setup script
./quickstart.sh

# Then run SUM
python sum_simple.py
```

### Option 3: Docker Compose (Production-Ready)

```bash
# Start everything with one command
docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yml up

# Access at http://localhost:80
```

## What About Redis Being Paid?

**GREAT NEWS: Redis is 100% FREE and open source!**

- **Redis Core**: Always free, always will be
- **Redis Labs Cloud**: This is the paid hosting service
- **Our Usage**: We use free, self-hosted Redis

Think of it like:
- **Git**: Free and open source
- **GitHub**: Paid hosting service
- You can use Git without paying for GitHub!

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Check if it's working
curl localhost:3000/health

# 2. Summarize some text
curl -X POST localhost:3000/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your long text here..."}'

# 3. Check stats
curl localhost:3000/stats
```

## Understanding the Setup

### Minimal Version (quickstart_local.py)
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Works immediately  
- ‚úÖ Great for testing
- ‚ùå No persistence
- ‚ùå No distributed features

### Simple Version (sum_simple.py)
- ‚úÖ Redis for caching (FREE)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready
- ‚úÖ Handles high load
- ‚úÖ Persistent cache

### Intelligence Version (sum_intelligence.py)
- ‚úÖ All simple features
- ‚úÖ Pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ User memory
- ‚úÖ Smart suggestions
- üîß Needs PostgreSQL (also FREE)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot connect to Redis"
```bash
# Start Redis with Docker (FREE!)
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Or install locally (Mac)
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

### "Model takes forever to load"
This is normal! The AI model is 1.6GB and loads once. After that, it's instant.

### "Port already in use"
```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill it if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

## The Philosophy in Action

Remember, this entire quick start guide could have been:
- 20 pages of complex setup
- 15 configuration files
- 200 environment variables
- 5 layers of abstraction

Instead, it's:
- Run one file
- It works

**That's the power of simplicity.**

## Next Steps

1. **Try the local version first** - See it work instantly
2. **Run the tests** - Understand what it does
3. **Look at the code** - It's only 200 lines!
4. **Deploy to production** - It's actually ready

## Still Have Questions?

The entire codebase is 766 lines. You can read it all in 30 minutes.

That's not a bug. That's the feature.
