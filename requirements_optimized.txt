# SUM Optimized Requirements - Carmack Principles Applied
# Minimal dependencies for maximum performance and reliability

# Core web framework
Flask==2.3.3
Werkzeug==2.3.7

# Essential NLP (lazy loaded)
nltk==3.8.1

# Performance and utilities
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Optional: For enhanced features (can be removed for minimal deployment)
numpy==1.25.2

# Development and testing (optional)
pytest==7.4.0
pytest-cov==4.1.0

# Note: Dramatically reduced from 99 lines to 12 lines
# Removed unnecessary dependencies:
# - Heavy ML libraries (scikit-learn, gensim, etc.) - not needed for core functionality  
# - Visualization libraries (matplotlib, wordcloud) - API-only deployment
# - Document processing (PyPDF2, python-docx) - can be added as needed
# - AI model libraries (openai, anthropic) - future enhancement
# - Multiple development tools - kept only essentials

# This minimal set provides:
# - Fast installation and deployment
# - Reduced attack surface  
# - Lower memory usage
# - Simpler dependency management
# - Better production stability
