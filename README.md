## üåü **Advanced Hierarchical Architecture**

SUM has evolved beyond traditional summarization into a **professional knowledge densification system** with three sophisticated levels of abstraction:

### üéØ **Level 1: Concept Extraction**
Extract key thematic concepts and important terminology:
- `ANALYSIS`, `FRAMEWORK`, `METHODOLOGY`, `PRINCIPLES`, `APPROACH`
- Semantic importance weighting and context analysis
- Core concepts that capture document themes

### üéØ **Level 2: Core Summarization**
Achieve **high semantic compression** while preserving essential information:
- Advanced semantic importance ranking
- Information-theoretic compression with completeness validation
- Maximum density without information loss

### üéØ **Level 3: Adaptive Expansion**
Intelligent expansion based on content complexity analysis:
- Complexity analysis and information gap identification
- Hierarchical detail addition with coherence optimization
- Automatic determination of expansion necessity

### üåü **Insight Extraction Engine**
Extract key insights and significant statements from text:
- Pattern recognition for important information
- Context analysis and significance scoring
- Classified insights: `TRUTH`, `WISDOM`, `PURPOSE`, `EXISTENTIAL`, `ANALYSIS`

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start: Professional Text Processing**

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtotaO/SUM.git
cd SUM
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('punkt_tab'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

### Hierarchical Densification Engine Usage

```python
from SUM import HierarchicalDensificationEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = HierarchicalDensificationEngine()

# Your input text
input_text = """
The essence of effective analysis lies not in the accumulation of data, 
but in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships. Methodology 
is like a framework - it provides structure for systematic investigation.
"""

# Configure for optimal processing
config = {
    'max_concepts': 7,              # Level 1: Key concepts
    'max_summary_tokens': 50,       # Level 2: Core summary
    'complexity_threshold': 0.7,    # Level 3: Expansion trigger
    'max_insights': 3,              # Key insights
    'min_insight_score': 0.6        # Quality threshold
}

# Process through the hierarchical engine
result = engine.process_text(input_text, config)

# Access the three levels
print("Level 1 Concepts:", result['hierarchical_summary']['level_1_concepts'])
print("Level 2 Core:", result['hierarchical_summary']['level_2_core'])
print("Level 3 Expanded:", result['hierarchical_summary']['level_3_expanded'])
print("Key Insights:", result['key_insights'])
```

### Web API Usage

Start the server:
```bash
FLASK_PORT=8000 python main.py
```

Make API calls:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/process_text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Your input text here...",
    "model": "hierarchical",
    "config": {
      "max_concepts": 7,
      "max_summary_tokens": 50,
      "max_insights": 3
    }
  }'
```

## üß™ **Example Results**

### Input Text:
```
The essence of effective analysis lies not in the accumulation of data, but in understanding 
the underlying patterns and relationships. Methodology is like a framework - it provides 
structure for systematic investigation. In research, we often find that the more we 
analyze, the more complex patterns emerge.
```
