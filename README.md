## What is SUM?

SUM is a cognitive intelligence platform that transforms how you process, understand, and use information. It's not just a summarizer‚Äîit's an AI-powered thinking partner that anticipates your needs, learns your patterns, and amplifies your intelligence.

**One tool. Infinite possibilities.**

## Why SUM?

In 30 seconds, SUM can:
- Transform a 50-page PDF into key insights you'll actually remember
- Convert a 2-hour meeting recording into actionable decisions
- Turn scattered thoughts into structured knowledge
- Predict what information you'll need next‚Äîbefore you ask

## Revolutionary Features
