SUM (Summarizer): The Ultimate Knowledge Distiller


### "Depending on the author, a million books can be distilled into a single sentence, and a single sentence can conceal a million books, depending on the Author." - Me

## Mission Statement

SUM is a knowledge distillation platform that harnesses the power of AI, NLP, and ML to extract, analyze, and present insights from vast datasets in a structured, concise, and engaging manner. 
With access to potentially all kinds of knowledge, the goal is to summarize it into a succinct & dense human-readable form allowing one to "download" tomes quickly whilst doing away with the "fluff".

# SUM: Knowledge Distillation Platform

## Mission Statement
SUM is a knowledge distillation platform that harnesses the power of AI, NLP, and ML to extract, analyze, and present insights from vast datasets in a structured, concise, and engaging manner. With access to potentially all kinds of knowledge, the goal is to summarize it into a succinct & dense human-readable form allowing one to "download" tomes quickly whilst doing away with the "fluff".

## Benefits
- **Time-Saving**: Quickly grasp the essence of tomes & vast datasets, saving hours of research and analysis.
- **Deeper Understanding**: Uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and insights through SUM's advanced knowledge representation and visualization tools.
- **Effortless Knowledge Sharing**: Generate summaries that are easy to understand, share, and discuss, facilitating collaboration and sparking meaningful conversations.
- **Personalized Learning**: SUM's adaptive interface and tailored recommendations empower users to explore complex topics at their own pace and depth.
- **Poetic Summarization**: Generate concise, engaging, and memorable summaries, distilling wisdom from analyzed data and making complex information more accessible and enjoyable.

## Core Features
- **Omnidata Ingestion**: Ingests diverse datasets, including text, documents, databases, multimedia content, and APIs, to provide a comprehensive knowledge base.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Employs cutting-edge NLP, ML, and cognitive computing techniques to extract entities, sentiments, relationships, themes, and trends from textual data.
- **Knowledge Cartography**: Structures distilled knowledge into interactive, hierarchical knowledge graphs, ontologies, mind maps, and concept networks, revealing complex relationships and patterns.
- **Poetic Summarization**: Generates concise, engaging, and memorable summaries, distilling wisdom from analyzed data and making complex information more accessible and enjoyable.
- **Immersive User Experience**: Provides an intuitive, interactive interface with features like text trees, visualizations, quote carousels, and interactive simulations, allowing users to explore distilled knowledge in a captivating and immersive environment.
- **Running Total Summary**: Maintains a "running total" summary that continuously updates as data is processed, providing a concise and distilled representation of the entire dataset.

## What Sets SUM Apart
- **Cognitive Insights**: SUM's AI-powered engine uncovers hidden patterns, relationships, and trends, providing users with a deeper understanding of complex knowledge domains.
- **Poetic Summarization**: Generates concise, engaging, and memorable summaries, distilling wisdom from analyzed data and making complex information more accessible and enjoyable.
- **Adaptive Learning**: SUM's machine learning algorithms continuously learn from user interactions, refining its understanding of knowledge domains and improving the accuracy of its summaries and recommendations.
- **Running Total Summary**: Maintains a "running total" summary that continuously updates as data is processed, providing a concise and distilled representation of the entire dataset.

## Future Development Roadmap
### Short-term Goals (Next 6 months)
- Enhance NLP and ML Capabilities: Integrate new NLP and ML models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis.
- Expand Data Ingestion Sources: Add support for new data formats and sources, including APIs, web scraping, and IoT devices.
- Refine User Interface: Enhance the user interface to improve usability, accessibility, and overall user experience.
- Improve Poetic Summarization: Explore advanced techniques to generate even more creative and personalized poetic summaries.

### Long-term Goals (Next 12-18 months)
- Integrate with External Knowledge Graphs: Develop integrations with external knowledge graphs to expand SUM's knowledge base and facilitate collaboration with other AI systems.

## SUM Class Integration
The SUM class is an integral part of the SUM platform, responsible for text summarization, knowledge graph construction, and visualization. Below is a condensed version of the SUM class:

```python
class SUM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code here
        
    def load_data(self, data_source):
        # Load data from JSON files
        
    def preprocess_text(self, text):
        # Preprocess text
        
    def generate_summaries(self, texts, max_length=100, min_length=30):
        # Generate summaries
        
    def update_running_summary(self, summary):
        # Update the running total summary
        
    def identify_entities(self, text):
        # Identify entities
        
    def identify_main_concept(self, text):
        # Identify main concept
        
    def identify_main_direction(self, text):
        # Identify main direction
        
    def calculate_similarity(self, text1, text2):
        # Calculate similarity
        
    def process_knowledge_base(self):
        # Process knowledge base
        
    def identify_topics(self, summaries):
        # Identify topics
        
    def build_knowledge_graph(self, topics):
        # Build knowledge graph
        
    def visualize_knowledge_graph(self):
        # Visualize knowledge graph
        
    def run(self):
        # Run the SUM platform
```

The SUM class includes the `update_running_summary` method, which continuously updates the "running total" summary as data is processed. The `run` method also includes a step to print the final running summary after all the data has been processed and the knowledge graph has been constructed.

Some functions that are yet to be implemented 
(`identify_entities`, `identify_main_concept`, `identify_main_direction`, `calculate_similarity`, `process_knowledge_base`, `identify_topics`, `build_knowledge_graph`, and `visualize_knowledge_graph`)
