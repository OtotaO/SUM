# Universal Content Understanding

**One interface. Every content type.**

SUM's multi-modal magic: drop in images, audio, video, PDFs, or code—get structured insights instantly.

## What It Does

**Images**: Screenshots → structured insights, handwriting → text, charts → data  
**Audio**: Podcasts → summaries, meetings → action items, speech → transcription  
**Video**: Lectures → notes, screencasts → tutorials, scenes → key moments  
**PDFs**: Papers → citations + findings, reports → structured data  
**Code**: Repositories → architecture maps, functions → documentation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Multi-modal processing is included by default
python main.py

# Try the complete demo
python demo_multimodal_complete.py
```

**That's it.** Drop any file into the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

SUM automatically detects content type and routes to the optimal processor:

```
File Upload → Content Detection → Optimal Processing → Structured Output
```

**Invisible**: No configuration needed  
**Universal**: Handles any content type  
**Fast**: Optimized processing pipelines  
**Accurate**: Best-in-class extraction models

## Real Examples

### Research Paper → Knowledge Graph
```
Input: 50-page PDF research paper
Output: Abstract, methodology, findings, citation network, key figures
Time: 8 seconds
```

### Podcast → Structured Summary  
```
Input: 2-hour podcast MP3
Output: Key points, speakers, timestamps, actionable insights
Time: 45 seconds (real-time processing)
```

### Meeting Video → Action Items
```
Input: Zoom recording video
Output: Decisions made, action items with owners, follow-up questions
Time: 12 seconds
```

### Code Repository → Documentation
```
Input: GitHub repository
Output: Architecture overview, function descriptions, dependency maps
Time: 6 seconds
```
