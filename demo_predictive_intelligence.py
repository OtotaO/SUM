demo_predictive_intelligence.py - Comprehensive demonstration of the Predictive Intelligence System

This script showcases all the capabilities of the new predictive intelligence system,
demonstrating how SUM transforms from reactive to proactive knowledge management.

Features demonstrated:
- Context awareness and pattern recognition
- Proactive suggestion generation
- Intelligent scheduling and spaced repetition
- Knowledge graph construction and serendipitous connections
- Integration with existing Knowledge OS
