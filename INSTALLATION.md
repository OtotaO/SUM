## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get SUM
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtotaO/SUM.git
cd SUM
```

### Step 2: Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

### Step 3: Run
```bash
python main.py
```

**That's it.** Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start transforming content.

---

## What You Get

- **Invisible AI**: Automatically adapts to any content type
- **Temporal Intelligence**: Tracks how your knowledge evolves
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Anticipates what you need next
- **Universal Understanding**: Images, audio, video, PDFs, code
- **Real-time Processing**: Watch content transform live
- **Zero Configuration**: Just works, no setup required

---

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: Python 3.8+, 2GB RAM, 1GB storage  
**Recommended**: Python 3.10+, 4GB RAM, 2GB storage

**Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL2 recommended), Docker

---

## Installation Options

### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtotaO/SUM.git
cd SUM
docker-compose up -d
```
**Advantages**: Everything included, zero configuration

### Python Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtotaO/SUM.git
cd SUM
python -m venv sum_env
source sum_env/bin/activate  # or sum_env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
**Advantages**: Full control, easier development

---

## Verification

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test web interface
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process_text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "SUM transforms information into understanding."}'
```

**Expected**: Health check returns OK, processing returns structured insights.

### Test Revolutionary Features
```bash
# Knowledge OS
python knowledge_os_interface.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5001

# Progressive Summarization  
python progressive_summarization.py
# Open: progressive_client.html

# Multi-modal Processing
# Drop any file type into the web interface
```

---

## Configuration (Optional)

SUM works out of the box with zero configuration. But if you want to customize:

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Create .env file (optional)
FLASK_PORT=3000           # Change port
SUM_MAX_WORKERS=4         # Processing threads  
LOG_LEVEL=INFO            # Logging detail
```

### Custom Settings
```python
# In your code (optional)
from SUM import SumEngine

engine = SumEngine(
    max_summary_length=200,    # Longer summaries
    num_topics=10,             # More topic detection
    processing_threads=8       # More parallel processing
)
```

**Remember**: SUM's Invisible AI automatically optimizes these based on your usage patterns.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error**: Ensure you're in the SUM directory: `cd SUM`

**NLTK Missing**: Run: `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"`  

**Port Conflict**: Change port: `FLASK_PORT=5000 python main.py`

**Memory Issues**: Large files? SUM automatically handles this with streaming processing.

**Still Problems?** Enable debug mode: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python main.py`
